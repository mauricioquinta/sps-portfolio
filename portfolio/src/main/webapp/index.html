	  <h3 class ="iHead">About Me: a short history</h3>
	  <p class= "iBox">
	    My name is Mauricio. I was born in San Miguel, El Salvador 1998. I moved to the states, thanks to my dad, at age 7.
	    I grew up in northern Virginia less than an hour from DC.
	    I was a curious little kid, first I figured out how to speak english, then progressed with the childhood thing.
	    In middle school the tech-ed teacher said 'hey wanna build robots after school and stuff?' and that sounded dope so I started doing that.
	    In highschool I liked history and physics the most but math more than english.
	    I got really  into robotics and engineering in general, it seemed right up my alley.
	    I love problem solving, puzzles, and building things. I was particularly keen on programming!
	    So I got myself into an engineering school and decided to pursue a computer science degree, so here I am living the dream...
	    as my family's designated tech guy! Whooo!

	    <h3 class= "iHead">What I'm About</h3>
	    <p  class= "iBox" >
	      I'm a peaceful, calm, quiet kind of person. I just want everyone to get along.
	      My family and friends are a huge part of my life, I would not be where I am if it weren't for them.
	      I believe in giving back; the same way people helped me, I like to help whenever, however I can. 
	      I'm a really logical person, its just how I think. I take everything in stride, things don't always go how we expect them to go.
	      I enjoy life it's the greatest thing in the world.
	      I'm determined to enjoy it as best I can.

	    <h3 class= "iHead">Things I Do</h3>
	    <p  class= "iBox" >
	      I drink and I know things! I also used to be a Game of Thrones fan.
	      I'm a student mainly I spend the bulk of my time in classrooms and libraries. I'm a teacher as well.
	      I've worked kids from elementry to highschool, teaching computer science.
	      Last summer I got the chance to teach at a CS camp in Accra Ghana which was really exciting.
	      I program; my interest lie in AI and machine learning but need far more experience.
	      Now the cool stuff I do; I like to go hiking, spent alot of time in shenendoah.
	      I like to go kyaking and surfing which I've recently picked up.
	      I love traveling, I've been to Holland, France, Ghana, El Salvador, Morroco, and New Zealand hoping to add more once covid clears.
	      Thats the jist of it I also love to play soccer
